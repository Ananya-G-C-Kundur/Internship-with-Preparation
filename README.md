<h1>Day 6 of learning🚀</h1>
Today explored about "Introduction to Coding and Evolution of Language"
1. Got to know the difference between C, Python, Java languages
2. What is Programing Language
3. How Compiler Language is different from interpreted Language
4. Detailed Concept written code to execution how it happens with sample code
in C and Python
5. Got to the disadvantages and advantages of particular language and how we overcome that.
6. The language's that we are going to learn are all high level languages
7. C ----> Machine Dependent (also called platform dependent)
 Python -----> Machine Independent (also called platform independent)
 Java ------> It is a hybrid type of C and Python , Also called intermediate Language

<h1>Day 7 of learning🚀</h1> 
Today i explored about :
- Write once and run anywhere
- Understanding compiled and interpreted languages
1. The languages like C ,C++ are converted High-level language to Binary form in Source (Where the code is written)
2. Where the languages like Java, Python, JavaScript are converted High-level language to Binary language in Destination (Where the code is Executed)
3. Architecture how the written code will run 
4. How Java code runs (with the help of block diagram)
5. How Interpreter works
6. Drawback of Java is SPEED (because it is slower than C ,C++ Language)
7. With the implementation of JIT (Just in time compiler) how java become speed (we overcome by the drawback but not completely)
8. How JavaScript is famous for Browsers and with the support of "JavaScript Engine" we can run the JS code
9. How python code run (with the help of block diagram)

<h1>Day 8 and 9 learning🚀</h1>
In this two days I explored about 
- Development environment setup
- Java IDE Installation
In 8th day
1. Got the difference of Compiler and Interpreter
2. Editors (notepad, vscode......)
3. Debugger
4. Project Setting 
5. Standard libreries
6. Documentation
7. IDE (Integrated development Environment)
In 9th day
- Got the practical knowledge of the above mentioned things 
1. Explored different kinds of IDE's like Eclipse ,IntelliJ ...
2. The steps for installing java environment is your PC is
Step 1 - Install JDK for windows (You can install it by https://lnkd.in/dFAj_ASi )
Step 2 - After installing set up the environment in your PC
Step 3 - Using Java --version command you check the version of jdk installed in command prompt 
Step 4 - Install VScode (https://lnkd.in/gUCmPtv5)
Step 5 - After VScode installation Install the extension for java 
 1. Code Runner
 2. Debugger for Java
Step 6 - Written the java code and got the output 
These were the things i explored in 2 days

<h1>Day 10 of learning🚀</h1> 
Today explored "How to master coding?"
All of these are important to master coding:
1. Learn basics
2. Practice every day, incrementally work on harder problems
 - Try to solve Easy to Hard
3. Debug
 - When to debug your own code you come know where you are wrong and the flow of program in a step by step manner
4. Run ,make planned mistakes ,compile and debug
 - make a mistake by your own and check the error what it gives
5. Do mini fun projects
=> "Fall in LOVE with CODING" then no one will call you single 😅 just joking
6. Learn from others/github
 - A good Engineer will learn many things by seeing other good Engineers
7. Logic building 
 - don't start your coding journey with HARD problems go with EASY problems first like take your daily problem (real-world problem) and solve them
 - Example => Daily Expenses
 => Color block
 => Even number
 => Ascending order ect,.
Step 1 : Analyse
Step 2 : Algorithm
Step 3 : Pseudo code
Step 4 : Code in IDE

<h1>Continue of Day 10 Learning🚀</h1>
Explored about "Variables and Data types"
Before getting into one important thing to mention is "WHY" is the most important word you should always remember
1. Variables 
- Got to how was a life of coders before getting to know about variables
- To make programmer life easy the variables existed
- The answer for "Why variables ? "
 - Simplicity => readable
 - Flexibility => dynamic memory allocation
- we should not use "KEYWORD" as a variable name
- Don't use (i,j,k,m,n,x,y ...) these variable names 
- write a code using readable or understandable variable name
- compiler will work if in case you give i, j, k or age, height... variable name as well 
Example => Sugar Container
 variable name => Sugar
 value =>Sugar in the container
2. Data types
- Why we have data types
- How we faced problems before introducing data types
- before their was a concept like "Same size that fits to everyone" (faced many problems)
- After the data types introduced we over come that problem 
- Why Data types ?
 => Efficient use RAM
 => Type Casting
 => Type checking 
- How signed and unsigned datatype work
- Different data types
Completed with Day 10

<h1>Day 11 of Learning🚀</h1> 
Explored about "FUNCTIONS" part 1
=> In Computer Science ,functions are the main building blocks of Industry
Got to know about
1. What is FUNCTION ?
 - Same kind of task you should repeat again and again
2. Why FUNCTION ?
 - Code reusability (save time and memory)
 - Readability 
3. FUNCTION syntax
 - <return_type> <function_name> (Input arguments)
4. Difference between 
 - FUNCTION declaration
 - FUNCTION definition
 - FUNCTION Call / Invocation
5. FUNCTIONS are super important for interviews
 - Give the readable name for the functions 
 - The interviewers judge by the way of writing the code
6. What is the main function ? How it is used ?
 - main function is the starting point of the code
 - if you done any mistake like in case (lower and upper ) it will give us error
 - And try it by making your own mistakes in your code
7. What are the command line argument ?
8. Why python doesn't have main ?

<h1>Day 12 of learning🚀</h1> 
Explored about "FUNCTIONS" part 2
1. Writing your first code using function
2. understanding standard library print function
3. Creating your first function with no arguments
 - static void returnNothing(){
 //code
 }
4. Creating function with arguments and the return type
 - static int getSum(int numer1, int number2){
 //code
 return sum;
 }
 - here the return type is integer
 - arguments are "number1 and number2"
5. Calling a function within a function
6. Coming up with proper name of function
7. How do decide what should be input and output of the function ?
 - The arguments which you take is the input
 - The thing which you mention that to return that is the output 
of the function 
8. Deciding proper datatypes for input and output from function 
 - example of age you can use int datatype
 - for name you should use String datatype

<h1>Day 13 of learning🚀</h1>
