<h1>Day 6 of learningüöÄ</h1>
Today explored about "Introduction to Coding and Evolution of Language"<br>
1. Got to know the difference between C, Python, Java languages<br>
2. What is Programing Language<br>
3. How Compiler Language is different from interpreted Language<br>
4. Detailed Concept written code to execution how it happens with sample code
in C and Python<br>
5. Got to the disadvantages and advantages of particular language and how we overcome that.<br>
6. The language's that we are going to learn are all high level languages<br>
7. C ----> Machine Dependent (also called platform dependent)<br>
 Python -----> Machine Independent (also called platform independent)<br>
 Java ------> It is a hybrid type of C and Python , Also called intermediate Language<br>

<h1>Day 7 of learningüöÄ</h1> 
Today i explored about :<br>
- Write once and run anywhere<br>
- Understanding compiled and interpreted languages<br>
1. The languages like C ,C++ are converted High-level language to Binary form in Source (Where the code is written)<br>
2. Where the languages like Java, Python, JavaScript are converted High-level language to Binary language in Destination (Where the code is Executed)<br>
3. Architecture how the written code will run <br>
4. How Java code runs (with the help of block diagram)<br>
5. How Interpreter works<br>
6. Drawback of Java is SPEED (because it is slower than C ,C++ Language)<br>
7. With the implementation of JIT (Just in time compiler) how java become speed (we overcome by the drawback but not completely)<br>
8. How JavaScript is famous for Browsers and with the support of "JavaScript Engine" we can run the JS code<br>
9. How python code run (with the help of block diagram)<br>

<h1>Day 8 and 9 learningüöÄ</h1>
In this two days I explored about <br>

In 9th day<br>
- Got the practical knowledge of the above mentioned things <br>
1. Explored different kinds of IDE's like Eclipse ,IntelliJ ...<br>
2. The steps for installing java environment is your PC is<br>
Step 1 - Install JDK for windows (You can install it by https://lnkd.in/dFAj_ASi )<br>
Step 2 - After installing set up the environment in your PC<br>
Step 3 - Using Java --version command you check the version of jdk installed in command prompt <br>
Step 4 - Install VScode (https://lnkd.in/gUCmPtv5)<br>
Step 5 - After VScode installation Install the extension for java <br>

Step 6 - Written the java code and got the output<br> 
These were the things i explored in 2 days<br>

<h1>Day 10 of learningüöÄ</h1> 
Today explored "How to master coding?"<br>
All of these are important to master coding:<br>
1. Learn basics<br>
2. Practice every day, incrementally work on harder problems<br>
 - Try to solve Easy to Hard<br>
3. Debug<br>
 - When to debug your own code you come know where you are wrong and the flow of program in a step by step manner<br>
4. Run ,make planned mistakes ,compile and debug<br>
 - make a mistake by your own and check the error what it gives<br>
5. Do mini fun projects<br>
=> "Fall in LOVE with CODING" then no one will call you single üòÖ just joking<br>
6. Learn from others/github<br>
 - A good Engineer will learn many things by seeing other good Engineers<br>
7. Logic building <br>
 - don't start your coding journey with HARD problems go with EASY problems first like take your daily problem (real-world problem) and solve them<br>
 - Example => Daily Expenses<br>
 => Color block<br>
 => Even number<br>
 => Ascending order ect,.<br>
Step 1 : Analyse<br>
Step 2 : Algorithm<br>
Step 3 : Pseudo code<br>
Step 4 : Code in IDE<br>

<h1>Continue of Day 10 LearningüöÄ</h1>
Explored about "Variables and Data types"<br>
Before getting into one important thing to mention is "WHY" is the most important word you should always remember<br>
1. Variables <br>
- Got to how was a life of coders before getting to know about variables<br>
- To make programmer life easy the variables existed<br>
- The answer for "Why variables ? "<br>
 - Simplicity => readable<br>
 - Flexibility => dynamic memory allocation<br>
- we should not use "KEYWORD" as a variable name<br>
- Don't use (i,j,k,m,n,x,y ...) these variable names <br>
- write a code using readable or understandable variable name<br>
- compiler will work if in case you give i, j, k or age, height... variable name as well <br>
Example => Sugar Container<br>
 variable name => Sugar<br>
 value =>Sugar in the container<br>
2. Data types<br>
- Why we have data types<br>
- How we faced problems before introducing data types<br>
- before their was a concept like "Same size that fits to everyone" (faced many problems)<br>
- After the data types introduced we over come that problem <br>
- Why Data types ?<br>
 => Efficient use RAM<br>
 => Type Casting<br>
 => Type checking <br>
- How signed and unsigned datatype work<br>
- Different data types<br>
Completed with Day 10<br>

<h1>Day 11 of LearningüöÄ</h1> 
Explored about "FUNCTIONS" part 1<br>
=> In Computer Science ,functions are the main building blocks of Industry<br>
Got to know about<br>
1. What is FUNCTION ?<br>
 - Same kind of task you should repeat again and again<br>
2. Why FUNCTION ?<br>
 - Code reusability (save time and memory)<br>
 - Readability <br>
3. FUNCTION syntax<br>
 - <return_type> <function_name> (Input arguments)<br>
4. Difference between <br>
 - FUNCTION declaration<br>
 - FUNCTION definition<br>
 - FUNCTION Call / Invocation<br>
5. FUNCTIONS are super important for interviews<br>
 - Give the readable name for the functions <br>
 - The interviewers judge by the way of writing the code<br>
6. What is the main function ? How it is used ?<br>
 - main function is the starting point of the code<br>
 - if you done any mistake like in case (lower and upper ) it will give us error<br>
 - And try it by making your own mistakes in your code<br>
7. What are the command line argument ?<br>
8. Why python doesn't have main ?<br>

<h1>Day 12 of learningüöÄ</h1> 
Explored about "FUNCTIONS" part 2<br>
1. Writing your first code using function<br>
2. understanding standard library print function<br>
3. Creating your first function with no arguments<br>
 - static void returnNothing(){<br>
 //code<br>
 }<br>
4. Creating function with arguments and the return type<br>
 - static int getSum(int numer1, int number2){<br>
 //code<br>
 return sum;<br>
 }<br>
 - here the return type is integer<br>
 - arguments are "number1 and number2"<br>
5. Calling a function within a function<br>
6. Coming up with proper name of function<br>
7. How do decide what should be input and output of the function ?<br>
 - The arguments which you take is the input<br>
 - The thing which you mention that to return that is the output <br>
of the function <br>
8. Deciding proper datatypes for input and output from function <br>
 - example of age you can use int datatype<br>
 - for name you should use String datatype<br>
